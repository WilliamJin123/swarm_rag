Experimenting with swarm RAG

# 12-14

This dude [Richard](https://www.youtube.com/@richardaragon8471) is claiming that swarm RAG is just better than KG RAG straight up.

Since I've intuition-pumped that symbolic knowledge-graphs is how humans think / represent "knowledge", I naturally turned to KG RAG. These experiments serve to prove to myself the validity of swarmRAG and application of biological algorithms to AI in general.
